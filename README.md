# Advanced Computational Methods

This repository stores problem sets for my class on applied machine learning. 
Part of final grading was also a classification competition. The related files can be found
in the repository [Riding-free-on-KAGGLE ](https://github.com/FelixGSE/Riding-free-on-KAGGLE).

## Content of problem sets

Problem set 1:

- Function to generate a not linear seperable data set

Problem set 2:

- Shiny app computing and visualising linear discriminants using data from problem set 1 (app runs [here](https://felixg.shinyapps.io/myapp/))

Problem set 3:

- Distributed logistic regression with pyspark on AWS cluster

Problem set 4:
